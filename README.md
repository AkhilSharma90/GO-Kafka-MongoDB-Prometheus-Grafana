# GO-Kafka-MongoDB-Prometheus-Grafana
A Killer microservices project if you want to build something very serious.

Just a more advanced version of my earlier project - https://github.com/AkhilSharma90/go-grpc-graphql-microservices
Added monitoring and kafka to it essentially.

Inspired from - https://github.com/AleksK1NG/Go-Kafka-gRPC-MongoDB-microservice
